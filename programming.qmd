# Programming Notes 

```{r}
#|echo: false

options(conflicts.policy = "depends.ok")
```



## Advanced data wrangling

The tidy folks have also written many more [articles](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/index.html) on dplyr that are worth a look


## Tidy programming

Programming with dplyr can be complicated because of tidy evaluation.   This [programming vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) provides useful documentation on data masking and tidy selection

If you plan to do a lot of R programming, I highly recommend reading chapters 17-21 on [meta-programming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) in R
