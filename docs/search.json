NB, you must re-render the entire directory if anything changes in the .yml file (such as addition or deletion of a chapter)\nYou can specify render targets and ordering more specifically in project metadata, see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#render-targets\n\n8.1.2.1 PDF\nYou can specify rendering to PDF format by adding the following to your .yml file:\nformat: pdf: documentclass: book\nYou can then explictly render just the PDF format by specifying both the output format and the filename in the call to quarto_render:\nquarto::quarto_render(output_format = “pdf”,output_file = “dwt.pdf”)\nHOWEVER, as of 2023_0424 rendering to PDF in the stable release fails; I’ll attempt to install the dev version and test next"
