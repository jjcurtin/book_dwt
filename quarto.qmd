## Documents

## Presentations

[Overview](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations) of presentations and details on the use of [revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/), which has become my preferred format.  The revealjs [reference chapter](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html) and a [chapter on presenter tools](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html) are also useful.
